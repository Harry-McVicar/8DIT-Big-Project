    <h1>Nuclear Energy</h1>
    <p>Nuclear energy has stemmed from the modern physics concept of nuclear reactions involving both fission and fusion reactions. Fission reactions occur when an accelerated proton colides with a large nucleus, causing it to split up into smaller nuclei. Fusion reactions are the reverse process in which small nuclei collide under conditions of immense heat and pressure to form a larger nucleus. Nuclei are made up of nucleons which consist of protons and neutrons, held together by a strong interative force. The strong force is about 126 times the strength of the electrostatic repulsion forces between the positively charged protons, however, is extremely short ranged with a range approximately equal to the diameter of a nucleus. The vast majority of energy from nuclear power plants is produced from the nuclear fission reactions of uranium and plutonium. During the creation of the universe, all of the elements known to mankind except hydrogen which is the most basic element, consisting of just one proton and one electron, were formed during nuclear fusion reaction within stars. As stars burn, they produce extremely large amounts of energy which facilitates the energy required for fusion reactions to take place. This therefore causes the elements to fuse together and form larger more complex elements consisting of more nucleons with a higher atomic number.</p>
