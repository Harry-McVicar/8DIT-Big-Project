    <h1>Geothermal Energy</h1>
    <p>Geothermal energy is created from the heat produced deep beneath the crust of the earth, towards the earth's core. This energy was generated during the initial formation of the planet as well as from the radioactive decay of materials and is stored within rocks and fluids at the centre of the earth. Geothermal energy is extracted from the crust of the earth via geysers, hot springs, underwater hydrothermal vents and mud pots. These natural thenomena are created from magna heating nearby rocks and underground aquafiers, causing hot water to be released. Their heat can be captured and used directly for heat or, more commonly, their steam can be used to generate electricity. Most of the earth's geothermal energy is stored as pockets of dry geothermal heat which can be extracted by drilling into the earth's crust injecting water to create steam. These pockets of dry heat can be accurately located by a geologist by studying rock formations in the immediate environment which relates to core activity.</p>
