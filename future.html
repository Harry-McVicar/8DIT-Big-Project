      <h1>Overview</h1>
      <p>How we, as humanity, source the energy required to power the world has been a global dilemma ever since industrialisation. However, the research and development of renewable energy sources have only just been underway in recent decades. Since industrialisation, mankind has been relying increasingly on fossil fuels in order to meet our energy demands. Although, with the drastic environmental effects of fossil fuels being made clear, it is time we begin to explore alternative energy sources on a global scale in order to preserve the planet for future generations. Throughout this enquiry, I will address both the advantages and disadvantages of renewable energy, the obstacles faced at a global scale which complicate the transition to a renewable energy grid as well as the effects on the economy and society. This will ensure that the various range of viewpoints are addressed and unbiased conclusions can be reached. From this analysis, it is clear that the benefits of renewable energy far outweigh the costs and hence we should progress towards a 100% renewable energy grid, not only as a nation but at a global scale. In doing so, we can progress towards a net zero carbon future and achieve a more sustainable world for future generations. While it may not be possible to transition to a 100% renewable energy grid immediately, it is critical that we stage the transition in an achievable manner. Due to the unreliability of renewable energy causing variation in the electrical supply, it is considered risky to transition entirely without a backup source. Therefore, we may have to depend on fossil fuels as an alternative energy source when the renewable energy supply can no longer meet the demand. Otherwise, expensive infrastructure is required in order to ensure a steady electrical supply. While there will always be anti-environmentalists, who favour economic benefits over strict environmental regulation, the evidence gathered strongly argues against this opinion. Transitioning to a renewable energy grid is therefore an essential step for the preservation of life on earth and will unarguably act as the right of passage to a brighter future.</p>

      <h1>Fossil Fuels</h1>
      <p>Fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas are mined and extracted from the depths of the earth. These can then be processed within power plants and combusted on a colossal scale in order to produce the electricity which powers the households and businesses of modern society. Fossil fuels consist of non-renewable resources which exist in a limited supply within the environment. This means that they are being depleted over time and will become more scarce with future generations, causing global energy prices to rise. The combustion of fossil fuels releases greenhouse gases (GHGs) such as carbon dioxide and water vapour into the atmosphere alongside other harmful pollution. Greenhouse gases trap infrared radiation within the atmosphere and hence contribute to the devastating effects of global warming. During the complete combustion of fossil fuels, which occurs if there is a plentiful supply of oxygen, the products of water vapour and carbon dioxide gas are formed. During the incomplete combustion of fossil fuels, which occurs if there is a lack of oxygen, it can also produce the harmful waste products, carbon monoxide and carbon. Carbon monoxide is toxic to humans as when inhaled, it bonds to the haemoglobin in red blood cells, causing them to lose the ability to pick up oxygen molecules and ultimately leading to internal suffocation. If carbon particles are inhaled, it can lead to respiratory health problems such as asthma or potentially, in more extreme cases, lung cancer. Leftover carbon particles could also coat the leaves of plants, preventing them from being able to photosynthesise as efficiently and causing them to die. The carbon particles which end up in lakes or rivers can be eaten by aquatic animals, leading to various health problems. If the carbon dioxide molecules produced are dissolved in rain clouds, it produces acid rain which can erode buildings and lower the pH of the ocean, disturbing marine ecosystems. The combustion of fossil fuels can also produce the greenhouse gas, methane which is 40 times more harmful in terms of climate change than carbon dioxide. All of this evidence makes it clear that, from both an economical and environmentally-friendly point of view, it is vital that a more sustainable source of energy is implemented.</p>

      <h1>Renewable Energy</h1>
      <p>Renewable energy is a worldwide phenomenon which has been thoroughly evaluated in light of creating a net zero carbon future. Renewable energy is comprised of renewable resources which are sustainable as they either exist in an unlimited supply within the environment or are constantly being replenished faster than they can be consumed. Renewable energy sources include wind power, solar power, hydropower, tidal power and geothermal energy. All of these energy sources are considered carbon-zero, meaning they do not produce any pollution of greenhouse gases. Renewable energy sources currently account for just 26% of the world’s energy supply and we hence have a lot of growth to fulfil with many obstacles to overcome in the near future. While the transition to renewable energy will remove jobs from some sectors such as mining, it will create jobs in others with people required to construct and maintain renewable energy facilities. The World Resources Institute backed this fact, stating that “In 2019, clean energy jobs outnumbered jobs in the fossil fuel sector 3 to 1. At the start of 2020, the clean energy sector employed about 3.4 million workers in the U.S”. When it comes to renewable energy sources, one of the major issues is reliability. Many renewable energy sources such as hydropower, wind power, tidal power and solar power rely heavily on environmental factors such as the weather including rainfall and snowmelt. This means that it is very difficult to build a 100% renewable energy grid with the worry that the energy supply may not always meet the demand. This is very possible during dry months when hydropower is severely limited as well as during the cold winter months when heating and electricity are high in demand. If both of these factors simultaneously occur, alternative energy sources must be in place in order to meet the crucial demand of civilisation and prevent the world from coming to a standstill.</p>

    <div class="content" id="new-zealand">
      <h1>New Zealand</h1>
      <p>New Zealand is currently doing very well in terms of renewable energy compared to other countries with approximately 85% of NZ being powered by renewable resources. Over half of this is provided by hydropower which produces net zero greenhouse gas emissions. New Zealand is currently investing NZ$30 million into investigating the viability of pumped hydro storage. This form of renewable energy is generated via using cheap electricity to pump water out of a lake or river into an elevated artificial reservoir. The water can then be released back down into the main body of water, past an underwater turbine, generating electricity when it is most needed. The analysis is primarily based around Lake Onslow where developers could potentially build a pumped hydro storage station, if proven feasible, at a hefty cost of around NZ$4 billion. Investigations are also taking place into large mechanical towers which spin bricks of soil and salt, lifting them up and down in order to store and produce energy, using the physics principles of potential and kinetic energy. However, the infrastructure required to put these ideas into action is very expensive and requires vigorous construction and maintenance in order to achieve. Hence, we must investigate alternative solutions which will enable New Zealand to achieve its environmental targets such as reducing the energy demand by making electrical systems, including heating and lighting, more efficient. New Zealand's environmental goals include reaching a 100% renewable energy grid by 2035 as well as net zero carbon emissions by 2050. Around the world, cities, states and federal governments have been instituting renewable energy policies in order to boost growth in this expanding sector as well as implementing carbon pricing, fuel economy standards and building efficiency standards. With these investigations taking place, it is certainly possible to reach these goals and achieve a brighter, more environmentally friendly future.</p>

      <h1>Advantages of Renewable Energy</h1>
      <p>There are many advantages and disadvantages with regards to renewable energy which must be evaluated before implementing any irreversible action. Firstly, renewable energy is considered clean energy as it produces extremely low levels of pollution and GHG emissions. An NREL study found that “generating 35% of electricity using wind and solar in the western U.S. would reduce CO2 emissions by 25-45%”. This therefore improves the overall air quality and creates a healthier environment for residents who may have otherwise been subjected to fossil fuel pollution. A large proportion of the public’s tax money contributes to public health, specifically in curing diseases related to the various effects of fossil fuels. Transitioning to renewable energy sources would therefore save money and benefit public health. In contrast, fossil fuels produce grave environmental pollution and hence contribute to climate change and the degradation of air quality. The construction and maintenance of renewable energy systems creates jobs and can hence positively contribute to the economy. Renewable energy can stabilise global energy prices as the price depends solely on the installation cost of the infrastructure whereas the price of non-renewable energy may fluctuate depending on the availability of fossil fuels. As renewable energy technologies become refined and the efficiency is improved, energy prices will continue to decrease. It is also profitable as it saves money on operating and maintenance costs, with renewable energy facilities requiring significantly less labour than traditional power plants. The more renewable energy a country can facilitate, the more independent they will become in terms of their energy supply. This reduces the amount of money that is spent on exported resources, enabling more money to be spent domestically. Renewable energy enhances the resilience of electric grids and improves the accessibility of electricity in developing countries, without the expense of fossil fuels. If the infrastructure of renewable energy plants are distributed over a large enough geographical area, its reliability is indisputable. A country’s over-reliance on fossil fuels can cause trade disputes, political instabilities and unnecessary wars, jeopardising their economy and their security as a nation. Biomass energy uses organic waste such as vegetable oil, corn and soybean byproduct as well as algae to produce energy, reducing overall carbon emissions and the amount of waste that contributes to landfill. Through having multiple formats of renewable energy technologies, it creates a greater potential for electricity generation as the various forms of energy production are reliant on different environmental factors. All of these advantages suggest that an increase in renewable energy would change nations for the better, providing a cheaper alternative and healthier environment which is beneficial to everyone involved.</p>

    <div class="content" id="disadvantages">
      <h1>Disadvantages of Renewable Energy</h1>
      <p>However, there are also several disadvantages that accompany renewable energy which must be considered. The electrical generation capacity is currently too low as the energy demand cannot currently be met by the supply of renewable energy sources alone. This means that other sources must be in place such as expensive infrastructure or backup non-renewable energy power plants. The technology requires further refinement in order to maximise the efficiency of electrical production, which has been and will continue to develop progressively over the years to come. The installation of facilities requires a large upfront payment from investors as well as lots of land, with wind turbines and solar panels requiring a much larger amount of space compared to nuclear power plants. However, renewable energy facilities are generally set up in remote settings where land is abundant. This empowers people in the countryside by increasing the value of their land as well as electrifying remote towns and villages which raises vast opportunities. The batteries required to store the energy are very expensive at an estimated cost of NZ$14,000 - $35,000 and can be prone to wear out relatively quickly. Although, as technology is further refined, the cost and efficiency of the batteries will improve over time. Many forms of renewable energy still produce small amounts of pollution, particularly in the area of manufacturing. Biofuels are considered an ‘unclean’ form of energy as they still produce greenhouse gas emissions and can contribute to respiratory health conditions. Therefore, biofuels are one of the renewable energy sources which should be used less, compared to wind, hydro and solar power.</p>
